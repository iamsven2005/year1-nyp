What are the challenges you face when talking to your family or friend?
What were the difficulties you faced the last time you did a presentation?
Human communication is the process of using verbal and non-verbal messages to exchange information with others, to achieve shared understanding
Communication plays an ever-
present role in our lives
• Opportunities to communicate are everywhere
• Even when you don’t intend to express a particular idea or feeling, others may try to make sense of what you are doing (or not doing)
Once the communication the process begins, it expands infinitely as the people involved contribute their thoughts and exchange ideas
• The content dimension (“What”) of communication refers to the information that the speaker wishes to share
• The relationship dimension (“How”) of communication is usually less explicit and is affected by emotions, attitudes, and the interplay of power
• The sender (one or many) is the party who initiates (encodes) the communication process
• The receiver (one or many) is the party toward whom the message is directed (decodes) to
• The interaction between the sender(s) and receiver(s) is a simultaneous process
• A channel is a means of transmitting a message
• Channels may be sensory – visual, auditory, olfactory, etc.
• Examples: Emails, instant messages, phone calls, face-to-face meetings, websites social media, letters, reports
• Noise is any barrier that hinders the communication process
• External noise refers to any distractions in your environment (e.g. loud music playing)
• Internal noise refers to anything that is happening within you that gets in the way of effectively sending or receiving messages
• Physiological Noise: A physical condition that negatively affects your ability to communicate
• Psychological Noise: Thoughts and emotions that interfere with the transmission of messages
• Semantic Noise: When people use language for which meanings are not mutually shared
• Culture is a system of values, beliefs, attitudes, and norms shared by a group of people
• In today’s world, you have opportunities to interact with people from different cultures
• One of the most cited differences is the distinction between individualistic cultures and collectivistic cultures
• Men are described as instrumental communicators, primarily using language to accomplish a goal
• Women are described as expressive communicators, primarily using language to build relationships with others
• These findings should be treated as broad generalizations
• Mediated Communication occurs when we use media such as our mobile phones or the Internet to exchange our messages
• Although technology has expanded the ways we communicate, it has also increased the ways that we could be misunderstood by others
• Anonymity: We may not always know precisely who we are communicating with
• Appearance: We typically receive fewer non-verbal cues from the other party
• Distance: We can now easily communicate with people who are located far away from us
• Time: We have greater control over the timing and speed of our messages, especially for asynchronous platforms such as instant messaging and email
• Interpersonal Communication occurs between two individuals who simultaneously attempt to influence each other, usually to manage relationships
• It is different from Impersonal Communication, which treats people as objects or responds only to their roles rather than who they are
• Audience: The person you want to communicate with
• Purpose: The reason you want to communicate
• Setting: The situation surrounding the act of communication, which may either refer to a physical space or an emotional state of mind
• When communicating with people we don’t know well, we typically choose to respond using one of three methods:
• Passive = Sit back and observe further
• Active = Solicit information from other people
• Interactive = Directly engage with the person
• Using probes and questions while listening is a vital skill for generating good conversations
• Examples of effective conversation openers include a sincere compliment, a current topic in the news, questions about hobbies or interests, and remarks about the event or place you are in
• Self-disclosure occurs when we voluntarily provide information to others that they would not have learned otherwise
• We may begin and deepen a relationship by sharing thoughts, feelings, reactions, personal information, and confidence
• When we share information about ourselves with others, we expect them to reciprocate
• It might not be appropriate to disclose certain information during an early stage of the relationship
• The disclosure process always comes with an element of risk, because knowledge is a form of power
• In the real world, criticism is a commonplace fact of life
• If not handled properly, criticism can start a cycle of defensiveness that pollutes the communication climate between two individuals
• Fortunately, you can respond to criticism in ways that maintain or even improve your relationships
• By asking your critic for more information, you show you take their comments seriously
• It may be good to ask your critic to clarify their comments
• If you are confronted with an indisputable accusation, the best approach would probably be to face the music and issue an apology
• If the accusation is debatable, you may instead choose to agree with the critic’s right to their perspective on the matter
• Once your critic believes that you have understood their position, you may then ask for a chance to present your point of view
• Focus on finding a solution that will work for both of you using cooperative phrases
• Both parties in a relationship have varying needs and any unfulfilled needs may throw the relationship off-balance
• We could also be a victim of faulty assumptions if someone inaccurately interprets our behavior and blames us based on their perception of the situation
• Analysing the Situation and Audience• Putting the Presentation Together• Planning Visual Aids• Delivering and Rehearsing the Presentation• Dealing with Questions from the Audience
Develop Your Topic, Determine Your Purpose
• To Inform: To give an overview, to teach, define, describe, explain a thing, person, place, concept, or the process to aid in understanding
• To Persuade: To use the information to try to change or reinforce perceptions, ideas, or convictions (influence the values, beliefs, or attitudes) or to convince your audience to do something
• To Entertain: To get audience members to smile, laugh, or enjoy themselves; to amuse the audience

 A specific purpose is an audience-centered behavioral goal
• Not intended to be part of the speech but guides your preparation
• Specifies what you want audience members to be able to do by the end of your presentation
What is the takeaway? Begin with “At the end of my presentation, the audience will.
Develop Central Idea: Generate Main Points • Use Central Idea to generate Main Points
 
Determine what should be acknowledged – some well-known facts are generally known and need not be acknowledged.
• These sources must be acknowledged: Direct quotations; statements or ideas of others (even if paraphrased); statistics and any non-original visual materials
• Logical Appeal• Emotional Appeal• Speaker Appeal
• Verbal Delivery • Voice quality, Pitch, Rate, Pauses, Volume, Pronunciation, Articulation, Transitions, Accent, Vocal Dysfluencies, and Variety
• Non-Verbal Delivery • Eye contact, Facial expression, Gestures, Movement, Posture, Appearance
• Practise! Practice! Practice!
• Select the best method of delivery
• the moment your audience sets their eyes on you • the moment you open your mouth to speak • It is thus important to consider your Verbal and Non-Verbal Delivery
1. Prepare for questions 2. Repeat question 3. Maintain your style 4. Involve the audience
• Always anticipate some of the questions people may ask • Prepare for the worst and everything else will seem easier • Prepare backup visuals just to be used when answering anticipated questions • Some speakers prepare to manage the Q&A
• Repeat the question in case someone in the audience did not hear it 
• If you get complicated, with the emotional or multi-part question, restate it to make sure you understand it
• Repeating the question may give you a few precious seconds to formulate a good answer
• Maintain the same style and demeanor You used in the presentation
• A change in demeanor may suggest a lack of confidence in your position
• When you are asked a question you do not know the answer to, it is perfectly acceptable to say “Sorry, I don’t know
the answer to that now, but I’ll find out and let you know”, then take down the questioner’s contact details so you can get back to them.
• Use the 25-75 rule - direct about 25% of your eye contact to the person who asked the question and approximately 75% to the rest of the audience
• This helps you stay in control of the situation and keep the audience involved as well
• Another alternative tactic, especially if you are speaking to a well-informed audience, e.g. professionals, is to consider asking the room if anyone would like to respond
• You could even call out someone in the audience you know is an expert in that area

• Highlight one or two key points presented and ask if anyone would like to find out more.
• Restate it to make sure you have understood it.
• Do not spend too much time trying to answer the question and neglecting the rest of the audience. Try to invite answers from the rest of the audience
• Direct him/her to get to the point tactfully and politely. Select another member of the audience to ask a question or give an opinion/comment.

• A proposal is not a firm promise or commitment but its proposer is expected to follow through on the creation of a binding contract
• If submitted in response to a request for proposals (RFP), it normally constitutes a bid.
