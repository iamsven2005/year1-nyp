What are the challenges you face when talking to your family or friend?
What were the difficulties you faced the last time you did a presentation?
Human communication is the process of using verbal and non-verbal messages to exchange information with others, to achieve shared understanding
Communication plays an ever-
present role in our lives
• Opportunities to communicate are everywhere
• Even when you don’t intend to express a particular idea or feeling, others may try to make sense of what you are doing (or not doing)
Once the communication the process begins, it expands infinitely as the people involved contribute their thoughts and exchange ideas
• The content dimension (“What”) of communication refers to the information that the speaker wishes to share
• The relationship dimension (“How”) of communication is usually less explicit and is affected by emotions, attitudes, and the interplay of power
• The sender (one or many) is the party who initiates (encodes) the communication process
• The receiver (one or many) is the party toward whom the message is directed (decodes) to
• The interaction between the sender(s) and receiver(s) is a simultaneous process
• A channel is a means of transmitting a message
• Channels may be sensory – visual, auditory, olfactory, etc.
• Examples: Emails, instant messages, phone calls, face-to-face meetings, websites social media, letters, reports
• Noise is any barrier that hinders the communication process
• External noise refers to any distractions in your environment (e.g. loud music playing)
• Internal noise refers to anything that is happening within you that gets in the way of effectively sending or receiving messages
• Physiological Noise: A physical condition that negatively affects your ability to communicate
• Psychological Noise: Thoughts and emotions that interfere with the transmission of messages
• Semantic Noise: When people use language for which meanings are not mutually shared
• Culture is a system of values, beliefs, attitudes, and norms shared by a group of people
• In today’s world, you have opportunities to interact with people from different cultures
• One of the most cited differences is the distinction between individualistic cultures and collectivistic cultures
• Men are described as instrumental communicators, primarily using language to accomplish a goal
• Women are described as expressive communicators, primarily using language to build relationships with others
• These findings should be treated as broad generalizations
• Mediated Communication occurs when we use media such as our mobile phones or the Internet to exchange our messages
• Although technology has expanded the ways we communicate, it has also increased the ways that we could be misunderstood by others
• Anonymity: We may not always know precisely who we are communicating with
• Appearance: We typically receive fewer non-verbal cues from the other party
• Distance: We can now easily communicate with people who are located far away from us
• Time: We have greater control over the timing and speed of our messages, especially for asynchronous platforms such as instant messaging and email
• Interpersonal Communication occurs between two individuals who simultaneously attempt to influence each other, usually to manage relationships
• It is different from Impersonal Communication, which treats people as objects or responds only to their roles rather than who they are
• Audience: The person you want to communicate with
• Purpose: The reason you want to communicate
• Setting: The situation surrounding the act of communication, which may either refer to a physical space or an emotional state of mind
• When communicating with people we don’t know well, we typically choose to respond using one of three methods:
• Passive = Sit back and observe further
• Active = Solicit information from other people
• Interactive = Directly engage with the person
• Using probes and questions while listening is a vital skill for generating good conversations
• Examples of effective conversation openers include a sincere compliment, a current topic in the news, questions about hobbies or interests, and remarks about the event or place you are in
• Self-disclosure occurs when we voluntarily provide information to others that they would not have learned otherwise
• We may begin and deepen a relationship by sharing thoughts, feelings, reactions, personal information, and confidence
• When we share information about ourselves with others, we expect them to reciprocate
• It might not be appropriate to disclose certain information during an early stage of the relationship
• The disclosure process always comes with an element of risk, because knowledge is a form of power
• In the real world, criticism is a commonplace fact of life
• If not handled properly, criticism can start a cycle of defensiveness that pollutes the communication climate between two individuals
• Fortunately, you can respond to criticism in ways that maintain or even improve your relationships
• By asking your critic for more information, you show you take their comments seriously
• It may be good to ask your critic to clarify their comments
• If you are confronted with an indisputable accusation, the best approach would probably be to face the music and issue an apology
• If the accusation is debatable, you may instead choose to agree with the critic’s right to their perspective on the matter
• Once your critic believes that you have understood their position, you may then ask for a chance to present your point of view
• Focus on finding a solution that will work for both of you using cooperative phrases
• Both parties in a relationship have varying needs and any unfulfilled needs may throw the relationship off-balance
• We could also be a victim of faulty assumptions if someone inaccurately interprets our behavior and blames us based on their perception of the situation
• Analysing the Situation and Audience• Putting the Presentation Together• Planning Visual Aids• Delivering and Rehearsing the Presentation• Dealing with Questions from the Audience
Develop Your Topic, Determine Your Purpose
• To Inform: To give an overview, to teach, define, describe, explain a thing, person, place, concept, or the process to aid in understanding
• To Persuade: To use the information to try to change or reinforce perceptions, ideas, or convictions (influence the values, beliefs, or attitudes) or to convince your audience to do something
• To Entertain: To get audience members to smile, laugh, or enjoy themselves; to amuse the audience

 A specific purpose is an audience-centered behavioral goal
• Not intended to be part of the speech but guides your preparation
• Specifies what you want audience members to be able to do by the end of your presentation
What is the takeaway? Begin with “At the end of my presentation, the audience will.
Develop Central Idea: Generate Main Points • Use Central Idea to generate Main Points
 
Determine what should be acknowledged – some well-known facts are generally known and need not be acknowledged.
• These sources must be acknowledged: Direct quotations; statements or ideas of others (even if paraphrased); statistics and any non-original visual materials
• Logical Appeal• Emotional Appeal• Speaker Appeal
• Verbal Delivery • Voice quality, Pitch, Rate, Pauses, Volume, Pronunciation, Articulation, Transitions, Accent, Vocal Dysfluencies, and Variety
• Non-Verbal Delivery • Eye contact, Facial expression, Gestures, Movement, Posture, Appearance
• Practise! Practice! Practice!
• Select the best method of delivery
• the moment your audience sets their eyes on you • the moment you open your mouth to speak • It is thus important to consider your Verbal and Non-Verbal Delivery
1. Prepare for questions 2. Repeat question 3. Maintain your style 4. Involve the audience
• Always anticipate some of the questions people may ask • Prepare for the worst and everything else will seem easier • Prepare backup visuals just to be used when answering anticipated questions • Some speakers actually prepare in order to manage the Q&A
• Repeat the question in case someone in the audience did not hear it 
• If you get complicated, the emotional or multi-part question, restate it to make sure you understand it
• Repeating the question may give you a few precious seconds to formulate a good answer
• Maintain the same style and demeanour You used in the presentation
• A change in demeanour may suggest a lack of confidence about your position
• When you are asked a question you do not know the answer to, it is perfectly acceptable to say “Sorry, I don’t know
the answer to that now, but I’ll find out and let you know”, then take down the questioner’s contact details so you can get back to them.
• Use the 25-75 rule - direct about 25% of your eye contact to the person who asked the question and approximately 75% to the rest of the audience
• This helps you stay in control of the situation and keep the audience involved as well
• Another alternative tactic, especially if you are speaking to a well-informed audience, e.g. professionals, is to consider asking the room if anyone would like to respond
• You could even call out someone in the audience you know is an expert in that area

• Highlight one or two key points presented and ask if anyone would like to find out more.
• Restate it to make sure you have understood it.
• Do not spend too much time trying to answer the question and neglecting the rest of the audience. Try to invite answers from the rest of the audience
• Direct him/her to get to the point tactfully and politely. Select another member of the audience to ask a question or give an opinion/comment.

• A proposal is not a firm promise or commitment but its proposer is expected to follow through for the creation of a binding contract
• If submitted in response to a request for proposals (RFP), it normally constitutes a bid.

Reports Defined
• In the organisational context,
a report is a formal document
that is meant to disseminate
information and/or aid the
decision-making process
• The need for reports increases
when an organisation grows
bigger, as it becomes more
difficult to transmit
information from one
employee to another
accurately

Accuracy
• Effective decisions can only be
made if they are based on
accurate information
• The effective writer attempts
to gather accurate and
objective data and presents it
to the reader
• Correct data is conveyed
through accurate number use,
word choice, spelling,
grammar, and punctuation

Conciseness
• Concise writing is
characterised by a lack of
clichéd expressions,
redundant statements, and
superfluous words
• Do note that conciseness
does not simply mean
minimising the number of
words above everything else

Clarity
• A general rule for achieving clarity is to rely on simple and familiar words
• While short sentences contribute to clarity, too many of them may tend to result in a disjointed and unprofessional writing style

Informational Reports present facts and data without any form of analysis or recommendations
• Types of Informational Reports:
• Reports to Monitor and Control Operations
• Reports to Implement Policies and Procedures
• Reports to Demonstrate Compliance
• Reports to Document Progress

Comparison: Similarities/Differences; Advantages,
Disadvantages
• Importance: Most important to least
• Sequence: Steps, sequence
• Chronology: Most recent to not so recent, or vice versa
• Spatial Layout: Physical attributes, R->L; Top to bottom etc
• Geographic Location: Region, NSEW
• Category: e.g. sales, profits, loss, different sections etc

When writing for audiences that are supportive, the report should focus on your recommendations at the beginning
• When writing for audiences that are hostile/sceptical, the report should focus on logical arguments and supporting details before concluding

A survey can provide invaluable insights, but only if it is reliable (produces consistent results if repeated) and valid (measures what it is supposed to measure)
• Nowadays, companies increasingly rely more on online survey services such as SurveyMonkey, Typeform, and Google Forms

When selecting people to participate in a survey, the most critical task is getting a representative sample of the entire population being examined
• One must be careful to avoid sampling bias, where some members of the intended population are less likely to be included than others

• Provide clear instructions
• Keep the questionnaire short and easy to answer
• Formulate answer options that are easy to understand
• Avoid leading questions that could bias your survey
• Avoid ambiguous questions
• Ask only one thing for each question

• Title Page
• Usually contains the title of report, the recipient’s name/organisation, writer’s name/organisation, and date of submission
• Table of Contents
• List the headings exactly as they appear in the report
• List of Illustrations
• List the illustrations by their order of appearance in the report
• Executive Summary
• Provides a concise 1-2 page summary of the report
• Purpose
• Identifies the specific problem that the report attempts to address
• Background
• Gives the background of the situation or a history of the problem
• Findings/Discussion
• This is usually the longest portion of the report
• In this section, you present your argument with corresponding evidence and relevant data
• Findings/Discussion
• If you have more than one main point, separate them by using headings
• If you conducted surveys, you need to provide a summary of your survey methodology and results
• Remember to use technical terms and quantifiers when doing a scientific report
• Conclusion
• Summarise key points that you have made in the body of the report
• Try to avoid introducing any new information
• Typically not more than 1 page in length
• Recommendations
• Propose action items that would solve the problem or improve the situation
• For controversial topics, provide a brief explanation after each point made
• This section may be placed at the beginning when using the direct approach 
• References
• Contains the full details of all works that are cited in the report
• There are numerous citation styles available such as APA and MLA
• The style adopted should be consistent across the references
• Appendices
• Document that can be used to supplement the main text
• Examples: Questionnaires, interview transcripts, glossaries, tabulations of data, statistical formula, extra diagrams of results, drawings, photographs

A table is used to present detailed information that can be arranged in rows and columns
A line chart is used to illustrate trends over time or relationships between two variables
A bar chart is used to compare quantities between different categories
A pie chart is used to show relative percentages adding up to 100%
A flow chart is used to illustrate processes or procedures

• Media Literacy is the ability to identify various types of media and evaluate the messages they are sending
• It builds an understanding of the role of mass media in society and contributes to the formation of essential 21st century skills that are necessary for citizens of progressive nations
• Critical Thinking: You can evaluate whether the media messages presented to you are credible and why certain details are included or omitted
• Perspective-Taking: You acquire a better understanding of an author’s perspective and what their goals are in creating and conveying a particular piece of information
 Fake news is defined as false and often sensational information disseminated under the guise of official news reporting
• The term was first popularised by President Donald Trump and his campaign team during the US Presidential Election 2016 and has now become a common term in everyday communication
• Misleading Content: Selectively chosen real facts that are reported to gain attention, but tend to be a misrepresentation of scientific research
• Manipulated Content: Unofficial altering or modification of existing photos or videos to trick viewers into believing something untrue
• Hoax or Clickbait: News that has been fabricated deliberately either to make money through amassing clicks or attracting public attention
• Satire or Parody: Publishing fictitious and often humorous news stories with the primary intention to entertain others
• Baseless fear is stirred in the public, leading to mass panic
• Resources are wasted as the authorities have to check the validity of claims
• Reputations are hurt when false allegations are made Innocents lose money to scams
• Social divisions are deepened, potentially causing social disharmony
• Threat to democracy, such as through influencing and rigging an election
Be aware that there are actors out there who seek to either manipulate or influence you
• Be skeptical of sensational headlines and investigate the source before reposting on social media
• Confirm with other reliable sources to see if the same story is running on multiple official media platforms
Does the source have a good reputation for being honest and reliable in the production of information?
• Is the author a recognised expert on the subject matter, a professional journalist, or merely an individual with an opinion?
Can you independently verify the source material? Verification can uncover mistakes, especially when the topic being addressed is a complex one
• Is the source material completely presented with proper referencing? Missing details may indicate some form of deliberate misrepresentation

• Advocate: Champion a cause
• Advertise: Promote a product
• Inform: Share a finding
To properly interpret a given piece of information, you need to be aware of the author’s background and assumptions
Information literacy is the ability to think critically and make balanced judgements about information that we find and use.

A group consists of a small number of people; has a common purpose, feels a sense of belonging and exerts influence on others in the group.
• Both groups and teams are made up of a small group of people who work to achieve a goal.
A team, however, is a group that is structured deliberately to achieve the goal, and they usually spend a great deal of time coordinating their efforts to accomplish the goal.
• Every team is a group but not every group is highly organised or coordinated enough to meet the definition of a team.
Sometimes a group or team has members who are not in the same physicaBenefits: save travel time and expense; 
technology can keep a virtual group on task and, in a computer-mediated meeting, ideas can be captured and recorded quickly and accurately l location but who are connected via an electronic channel
Downside: may be difficult to keep some members on task; may take longer to develop trust among group members; increased speed of technology may hinder time for reflection and evaluation of points
The success of a team is directly related to the members that are in it.
• Having an Open Mind: Open-minded to ideas, solutions and people
Preparing and Participating Effectively: Coming to a meeting prepared, and willing to participate actively and effectively
Using the Problem-Solving Procedure Effectively: 
Identify problem -> analyse problem -> establish criteria -> generate possible solutions ->apply criteria to selected best solution -> implement and follow- up

Handling Conflicts Effectively: Conflict is inevitable, the difference is how members handle it. Assertive style is better than aggressive orpassive-aggressive styles. 

Who will begin the
presentation?
• Who needs to present
which information?
• How will you transition
from one speaker to
another? How much
time to allocate?
• Where will the rest of
the team members be?
Standing? Sitting while
one is speaking?
Who will manage the
Q&A that will come up
during the
presentation?
• Who will create the
visual aids so that they
are consistent and are
prepared in time for
rehearsals?

A successful team presentation must come off as one.
• The team leader successfully guides (not dictates) the team to decide on the specific outcome to be achieved
• Members must “buy-in” to the team’s goals and messages
From this, the theme that ties the individual presentations together is decided.
• All members can then begin to see how everything will fall into place and get an idea of what each member will discuss.
Have an outline and divide the topics/sections among members (who will then do the research and corresponding visuals).
Have another member to be responsible for the introduction and conclusion. During the Q&A segment, each member answers questions that relate to his/her topic/section.

Plan transitions and how to introduce the next speaker
• Enforce time limits strictly
• Coordinate visuals so the presentation seems coherent
• Practise as a group at least once; more is better
The presentation is well-rehearsed and well-coordinated
There is a smooth transition between speakers
Team members are well-versed with their own segments and areas of responsibility
Team members project a confident and knowledgeable image
Team members are aware of the team’s perspective and aims
Team members are responsive to the direction of the leader
Team members are supportive of one another

Greet the VIPs (very important persons) first, if they are present.
• If not, start with a simple greeting like “Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.”
• This should be followed by a brief self-introduction and an introduction of your team members.

Introduce the topic and state clearly the purpose of the presentation
• Let the audience know how they will benefit from it, i.e. tell them what’s in it for them.
• Include a preview of the main points in the presentation.
• State the segments each team member will present. Do remember the techniques of capturing the attention and interest of your audience.
 No more than 5 ideas, divided amongst 2-3 team members.
• All main points should be supported with facts, statistics, illustrations, examples and/or personal experiences. Ensure smooth transition from point to point and speaker to speaker.
The last speaker of the group should indicate that the team presentation is coming to an end with words like “in closing,” “in conclusion” or “one last point”.
• He/She should then provide a short overview of the main points covered by all his/her teammates.
• The conclusion could be made more memorable by using quotations, catchy remarks or relevant anecdotes which best emphasize the team theme.
  Ensure verbal and non-verbal behaviour of all team members add to the success of the presentation.
• You can refer/link to the points made by previous speakers e.g. “as xx has mentioned ...” or “according to my xx speaker, ...” but ensure coherence and all are on the same page.
Some teams do well at their presentations only to falter at the Q&A
• The key to handling this segment effectively is preparation and maintaining your composure during the session.

Perception: Everyone has their own unique perception of reality, which is shaped by their personality traits and life experiences.
Emotions: There are a range of human emotions that may affect communication, including sadness, anger, and happiness.
Attention: When a person's mind is distracted or preoccupied, they will have difficulty forming messages or interpreting messages from others.

Affectionate emotions include happiness and liking. 
Happiness is the most universally recognized of all human emotions. When we feel happy, we tend to want to communicate with others more frequently and for longer durations. 
Liking is the positive evaluation of another person's behavior. When we like someone, we are also more likely to desire to initiate contact with them.

Hostile emotions include anger and jealousy. 
Anger is the emotion we feel when we perceive we have been wronged. When we feel offended by others, we might make unpleasant facial expressions or verbally insult that person. 
Such actions may prevent effective communication from taking place. 
Jealousy occurs when we feel a strong desire for something that another person has, which may lead to an unfriendly or passive-aggressive attitude towards them. 

Depressive emotions include sadness and fear. 
Sadness involves feeling unhappy, sorrowful, and discouraged. When we are sad, we usually withdraw from the communication process to focus on improving our mood. 
Fear occurs when we perceive an external threat to our well-being. 
While fear induces physiological changes make us aware of potential danger, it also causes us to take a (literal) step back from interacting or engaging with others.

Ambiguous Language: Words or phrases that lack precision or sufficient clarity to guide understanding
Jargon: The specialised vocabulary that a professional or cultural group uses to speed up their communication process
Grammatical Errors: Violation of standard linguistic rules that result in poorly constructed phrases or sentences 

One of the common semantic barriers to creating shared meaning and successful verbal encoding is our tendency to use ambiguous and imprecise language. 
Ambiguous words either posssess multiple meanings or may appear too broad to engender any meaningful interpretation by the receiver.

Deflection  The displacement of a structural member or system under a load.
Hemiparesis Paralysis or weakness on one side of the body.
Triadic     A color scheme built out of three colors equally spaced around the color wheel.
Blockchain  A digital ledger in which all cryptocurrency transactions are made.
Homeostasis  The regulation of an organism's internal life-maintaining conditions.

Survey: knowledge, behavior, characteristics, expectations, knowledge
Decide on the type of survey
Plan and draft survey questions
Select survey size and sample
Conduct survey and record data
Analyse data and present findings

Free form questions ask respondents to supply their own answer. No pre-defined answers are given, so respondents are free to write what they want. 
Example of Free Form Question:
"What could we do to make your experience at our hotel more enjoyable?”
Pros:
Allows respondents to articulate their thoughts
Addresses the issue of “why”
Cons:
Can be time consuming for respondents
Can be difficult to compare and analyse results

Multiple choice questions ask the respondent to choose between two or more options. Questions can be as simple as “Yes/No” or could provide a range of answers. 

Example of Multiple Choice Question:
where would you prefer to go on vacation?
New York
London
Japan
China
Pros:
Easier and quicker for respondents to answer
Allows you to easily compare and analyse results
Cons:
respondents may be frustrated if their desired answer is not a choice given (in the example above, the respondent may wish to visit Korea)
Forces respondents to give simplistic responses to complex issues

Respondents assess the issue based on a given dimension by providing a number of positive and negative choices, with each point holding the same amount of weight. 

Example of Rating Scale Question:
“On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 is short and 10 is long, how would you describe the amount of time you had to wait for our counter staff to serve you?” 
Pros:
Can assess your respondents' perception of a product or service
Easy to compile results
Cons:
It can be confusing if the scale is too large (e.g. from 1 to 20)
Can be hard to gauge the meaning of responses — one customer may classify a 2-minute wait as “long”, another could classify the same duration as “short"

Mutually Overlapping Options
–
What was your last drawn salary for the month of June 2019?
A) $0-$2500
B) $2500-$5000
C) $5000-$7500
D) More than $7500
In this example, the options provided are not mutually exclusive. This means one answer could fall into more than one category. 
For example, if the respondent earned exactly $5000 in June, should he then select Option B or Option C? 

Missing Neutral Option
–
Using a scale of 1 to 4 where 1 means strongly disagree and 4 means strongly agree, how much do you agree or disagree with the following statement: "I feel that NYP lecturers are competent in their area of expertise."
(1) Strongly Disagree        (2) Disagree         (3) Agree        (4) Strongly Agree
In this example, the option to select "Neutral" as a response is missing. Forcing respondents to answer a question on an even-numbered scale will bias your results as truly neutral people must select a category that does not truly represent their opinion.

What type of school did you attend just before coming to Nanyang Polytechnic?
A) MOE Secondary School

B) Institute of Technical Education

C) Overseas High School

D) Special Education School
In this example, the categories don't cover all possible scenarios. If a student was home-schooled and took his 'O' levels as a private candidate before qualifying for NYP, he wouldn't know which would be the most appropriate option to select.

Jargon, Slang, Abbreviations
People belonging to a profession or members of a distinct subculture may be familiar with jargon or slang but outsiders may be confused by their usage.
Also, avoid using abbreviations and acronyms. The same ones often have many meanings.
Vagueness
When crafting questions, it can be easy to make implicit assumptions that confuse your respondents. 
Indefinite words or response choices are also sources of ambiguity. 
Emotional Language and Prestige Bias
Words with strong emotional connotations can colour how respondents answer survey questions.
Prestige bias occurs when a highly respected group or individual is associated with an answer choice. 
Double-Barreled Questions
A double-barreled question consists of two or more questions mixed together.
Combining both questions into one makes it unclear what exactly is being measured, and each question may elicit a different response if asked separately. 
It is usually best for each question to be about only one topic.
Leading Questions
You always want respondents to believe that all answer choices are equally legitimate and never want them to be biased towards one answer. 
A leading (or loaded) question is one that leads the respondent to one particular answer choice over the rest due to how it is being phrased.
Issues Beyond Respondent Capabilities
Asking something that respondents don't know results in confusion, frustration, and inaccurate responses. 
Also, asking about an issue that respondents know nothing about (e.g. a technical issue in legal affairs or an internal policy of an organisation) tends to result in respondents giving unreliable and meaningless answers.
Double Negatives
Double negatives in ordinary language are grammatically incorrect and confusing.
