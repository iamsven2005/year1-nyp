In the real world, criticism is a commonplace fact of life
• If not handled properly, criticism can start a cycle of defensiveness that pollutes the communication climate between two individuals
• Fortunately, you can respond to criticism in ways that maintain or even improve your relationships
• By asking your critic for more information, you show you take their comments seriously
• It may be good to ask your critic to clarify their comments
• If you are confronted with an indisputable accusation, the best approach would probably be to face the music and issue an apology
• If the accusation is debatable, you may instead choose to agree with the critic’s right to their perspective on the matter
• Once your critic believes that you have understood their position, you may then ask for a chance to present your point of view
• Focus on finding a solution that will work for both of you using cooperative phrases
• Both parties in a relationship have varying needs and any unfulfilled needs may throw the relationship off-balance
• We could also be a victim of faulty assumptions if someone inaccurately interprets our behavior and blames us based on their perception of the situation
