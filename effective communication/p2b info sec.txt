A great way to get a long password that’s easy to remember is to use passphrases. At one time, the recommendation was to use complex passwords with random characters and numbers, but those can be hard to remember, confusing, and difficult to type. Passphrases are a series of random words or a sentence that are much easier to remember and type, but still hard for cyber attackers to hack.

1. Keep patches up-to-date by installing them
weekly or daily, if possible
2. Shut down unnecessary / unused ports and
services
3. Use strong passwords and change them often
