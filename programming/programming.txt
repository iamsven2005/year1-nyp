CSS:

HTML DOM:
CSS
Imagine we have this website which we want to style. We may want all h1 headings to have a certain style, 
all elements of the class "normalPara" to take another style (e.g. red) and 
different paragraphs with different ids to adopt yet another style (e.g. one bold, one italic). 
 HTML tag type selector
 Class selector
 Id selector
A tag type selector allows us to select all the html elements with the specified tag type for styling. The style to be applied is specified in a declaration block enclosed by curly braces.
Assign CSS properties to a group of elements who has the same value for their class attribute. A class selector starts with a dot e.g. .center selects all html element with a class attribute value of center
Using an id selector, we assign CSS properties to a particular elements which has the id value. An id selector starts with # notation, for example, #specialNote { color:red; } sets the text color of the paragraph with an id value of specialNote to red as shown in the screen shot below.
font-family configures the font typeface of the text. 

Start with the font you want, and always end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.

Example:

p {
 font-family: "Comic Sans", Georgia, Serif;
 }

h2 { font-size:150%; } sets the font for heading 2 to 1.5 times of its default size.
Example:

h1 { 

    font-weight: bold; 

}

h1 { font-style: italic; }
