Pot of gold: Highlight an opportunity (often financial) that your audience hasn’t spotted on the horizon.
Ticking time bomb: In contrast, highlight a significant, impending threat that your audience isn’t prepared for.
Boiling frog: Highlight a threat that could creep up on your clients
 (the – rather gruesome – theory being that if you drop a frog into boiling water it will jump straight out, 
but if you heat it slowly it will not sense the change in temperature).
 Our ‘Cost Boomerang’ campaign for KPMG is a good example of the frog in action!
